Completed the workshop already? Need something else to do? Here are some other things to try

## Have a conversation with Copilot

In this section we will use Copilot: [https://copilot.microsoft.com](https://copilot.microsoft.com/).

Unlike the conversation-based models such as ChatGPT in Azure OpenAI Service, Copilot's responses are not limited by the underlying natural language model alone. Copilot uses a variety of techniques to provide "grounding" for its responses, including the results of live Web searches. This means that Copilot can use current information, not just information that was included in the model's training data, to inform its responses. 

Copilot also offers three interaction modes: Creative, Balanced, and Precise, which allow you to control the tradeoff between the relevance of the responses and the creativity of the responses.

Let's try some examples to see how this works in practice.

### Have an ongoing conversation

Start with Copilot in Balanced mode. Ask any question you like. Ask for followups-too! You can also use the suggested continuation buttons to guide the conversation.

### Get information about recent events

Copilot is based on [OpenAI's GPT-4 model](https://blogs.bing.com/search/march_2023/Confirmed-the-new-Bing-runs-on-OpenAI%E2%80%99s-GPT-4), which was trained on data collected before September 2021. Nonetheless, thanks to the grounding techniques mentioned above, Copilot can provide information about recent and current events. 

First, enable "Precise" mode in Copilot by clicking the "New Topic" button and clicking the "More Precise" button.

Now, try these prompts, and compare the results to using the models in the Azure OpenAI Service playground:

```
When did Queen Elizabeth II die?
```
```
How's today's weather in Seattle, WA
```
```
What big news happened today?
```

Try other prompts and see what creative responses you can get!
