:::info Learn how to interact with OpenAI models
We hope that in the last hour, you've learned what natural language generative AI models are and how they work and understand the power of prompt-engineering. 
:::

## Some key points to remember
 - Generative AI models can generate human like text, images, and code
 - Generative AI models are stateless: they do not learn, and are constrained by their training data which is frozen at a fixed point in time
- Azure OpenAI Service is a managed service that provides access to state-of-the-art natural language generative AI models, including ChatGPT and GPT-4 from OpenAI with the security and enterprise promise of Azure.
- Azure OpenAI Service provides a simple REST API for accessing these models
- Prompt engineering is a technique for "grounding" generative AI models, and can be used to influence the style of their output, provide factual information, and constrain their behavior.
