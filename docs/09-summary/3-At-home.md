## At home

:::warning ADDITIONAL SETUP REQUIRED
This workshop can be completed at home as a self-guided session. However, this will require additional setup effort and dependencies as described.
:::

For a self-guided workshop, you will need the following: 

- [ ] An Azure Subscription → [Apply here for a free account](https://aka.ms/azure/free).
- [ ] Access to Azure OpenAI → [Apply here if required](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/overview#how-do-i-get-access-to-azure-openai).
- [ ] An Azure Open AI resource → [Create using Azure OpenAI Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal)
- [ ] A `gpt-3.5-turbo` model deployment → [Deploy using Azure OpenAI Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal#deploy-a-model)

You can then [navigate to the Azure OpenAI Studio](https://oai.azure.com/) to complete the exercises for a no-code experimentation experience.

:::info OpenAI Playground APP

The OpenAI platform has its own [Playground application](https://platform.openai.com/playground) that these exercises should also work on, once you log in with a valid OpenAI account. We encourage you to explore this on your own - but for our workshop documentation, we will focus on Azure OpenAI usage.
