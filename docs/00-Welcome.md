This is a **75-minute** workshop that will give you a hands-on introduction to the core concepts and best practices for interacting with OpenAI models.
:::

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you should be able to:

 - Describe GPT model capabilities and implementation
 - Understand prompt engineering concepts and best practices
 - Apply prompt engineering techniques to your own generative AI solutions


## Lab Outline

The lab is organized into sections, taking you from "understanding" (core concepts) to "doing" (hands-on exercises). Prioritize completing the exercises within the allotted time. You can then any remaining session time for open-ended exploration to build your own intuition for prompt engineering.

1. [Setup](/setup). Activate your access to the custom workshop Playground.
2. [Part 1](/Part-1-labs/Basic-Prompting). Learn the basics of interacting with the GPT Models .
3. [Part 2](/Part-2-labs/System-Message). Learn how to guide the models to ​create better answers.
4. [Concepts & resources](/ai-models).
5. [Learnings and Resources](/summary). Recap what you learned & identify next steps.
